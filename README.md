# DP Rankings App

## Main goals:

-   automatic/weekly sync to latest DP data c/o GH (?)

-   a drag and drop interface for reranking players

-   instantly recolour to provide context about your ranking vs consensus

-   save your rankings to a server, encoded with a user's ID [database? experiment with mongo?]

-   download your rankings to excel/csv

-   work on authentication so that you can login and retrieve old rankings, ideally hooking into a service like Auth0 to allow for self-serve signup/logins/third-party logins <https://github.com/curso-r/auth0>

-   integrate current DynastyProcess app styling c/o bs4Dash
