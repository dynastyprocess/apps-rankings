## What is Z Score?

FantasyPros provides an average ranking for each player and also a standard deviation, which helps measure how broad the range of opinions is for a given player. 

For example, if `Nick Chubb` has an average expert rank of 12.81 and a standard deviation of 4.1, the vast majority of expert rankers have Chubb between 8.7 and 16.9 (i.e. 12.81 +- 4.1). 

Comparatively, someone like Saquon Barkley currently has an expert rank of 3.0 with a standard deviation of 1.1, so the majority of expert rankers have Barkley between 1.9 and 4.1. 
We can use this information to calculate how far away from expert consensus `you` are by dividing the difference between your ranking and the expert ranking against the standard deviation.

If you have Nick Chubb at 8.7, you are (12.8 - 8.7)/4.1 = 1.0 standard deviations above the average on him (and this is displayed as a green colour). 

Z score is useful because it scales how far away you are by the natural range of expert opinions on the same player. Usually, 95% of all rankings are between -2 and 2 standard deviations away from the mean - if you are more than this, you are significantly higher/lower on that player.

## What is a Ranking ID?

All rankings are stored to the server with a Ranking ID - this allows you to look up the data later with this ID (and possibly start again from that ID by importing.)
